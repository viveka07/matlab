REGRESSION
Is a statistical tool to find relationships between two
variables
Linear regression- general equation y=ax + b
We use function lm()
lm(formula,data)
One variable is predictor variable another is response
variable
Lets consider a case to store height and weight of
people
-----------------
x <- c(5.1,5.5,5.8,6.1,6.4,6.7,6.4,6.1,5.10,5.7)
y<-c(63,66,69,72,75,78,75,72,69,66)
relation<-lm(y~x)
summary(relation)
//now to find the weight of the person with height 170
a<-data.frame(x=6.3)
result<-predict(relation,a)
print(result)
//this is how we use linear regression to predict
values
attributes(relation)
coefficients(relation)
abline(relation)
